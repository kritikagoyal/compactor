## Summary
arXiv:2604.00151v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Distributed applications use identifiers across database storage, trusted communication, and external access. Depending on their use, these roles require different combinations of storage efficiency, chronological sortability, origin metadata embedding, zero-lookup verifiability, metadata confidentiality, and multi-century addressability. The identifier schemes compared in this paper, including Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) versions 4 and 7, do not individually provide all six properties. We present Source-Known Identifiers, a three-tier identity system that distributes these properties across representations of one entity identity, connected through deterministic transformations. A 64-bit Source-Known ID (SKID) provides a timestamp-ordered database key. A 128-bit Source-Known Entity ID (SKEID) adds entity type, epoch, and a keyed message authentication (MAC) code to the SKID, enabling integrity and asserted origin metadata checks within a shared-key trust domain without record lookups. Secure SKEID encrypts this representation to conceal metadata while retaining linkability of repeated identifiers. A collision guard and cryptographic backward verification prevent generated ciphertext from being accepted as plaintext when generation and parsing use the same verification keys and acceptance policy. Evaluation combines specification and threat analysis, implementation tests, and microbenchmarks of the C#/.NET 10 reference implementation. On Apple M2 hardware, SKEID and Secure SKEID generation averaged 207.28 3.10 ns and 224.62 3.90 ns, respectively, compared with 361.94 1.94 ns for UUID Version 4 and 384.11 1.95 ns for UUID Version 7. values indicate 99.9% confidence interval (CI) margins. These results support the feasibility of deriving SKEIDs from 64-bit Source-Known IDs on demand.
