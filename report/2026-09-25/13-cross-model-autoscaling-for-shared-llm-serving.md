## Summary
arXiv:2609.29160v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Multi-model LLM serving is moving toward shared MaaS clusters, where co-hosted models compete for a fixed GPU budget while each model experiences time-varying demand and must satisfy its own latency SLO. Existing LLM autoscalers remain largely model-local: their signals expose local runtime activity or delayed latency outcomes, and their scale-up or provisioning decisions do not directly determine how shared capacity should be allocated across competing models. We present the Token-service-share Rebalancing Engine (TRE), a control-plane framework for hot-switched multi-model LLM serving. TRE introduces Token Service Share (TSS), a calibrated, demand-normalized signal that estimates effective token service per active or queued request and yields a comparable health score across heterogeneous models and SLO classes. Guided by TSS, TRE coordinates bounded receiver--donor capacity movement under a fixed GPU budget: it separates fast rescue from slower rebalancing and incrementally reallocates active replicas toward models with the largest calibrated service deficits. We implement TRE on a Kubernetes-based hot-switch serving stack without modifying the inference scheduler. Across seven LLM serving traces, TRE reduces P95 end-to-end latency by 11.9--79.0\% and P99 latency by 12.5--72.6\% compared with a state-of-the-art KV-cache-based reactive autoscaler running on the same hot-switch runtime. The gains hold on both targeted stress probes and production-derived conversation/code traces, where TRE reduces P95/P99 latency by 50.8/63.7\% and 79.0/72.6\%, respectively. These results show that effective hot-switched autoscaling requires not only fast replica actuation, but also calibrated service-deficit signals and coordinated cross-model capacity arbitration.
