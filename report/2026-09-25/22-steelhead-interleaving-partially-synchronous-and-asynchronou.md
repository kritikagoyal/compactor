## Summary
arXiv:2609.30163v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Dual-mode consensus protocols are fast when the network is partially synchronous and remain live under asynchrony. We introduce Steelhead, a dual-mode mechanism that composes a partially synchronous and an asynchronous commit rule over one DAG: every k-th round is decided by the asynchronous rule, whose leader a common coin reveals after the votes, and all other rounds by the partially synchronous rule. Every interval, validators replay the committed DAG under each candidate period, adopt the one with the fewest expected message delays, and fall back to k = 1 when the output stalls; the asynchronous rule applied to the coin rounds alone keeps the protocol live. Steelhead sends no message beyond the DAG's blocks, not even to agree on the period, and opens a coin only on the rounds that need a hidden leader. It is generic over pairs of DAG commit rules that share a committee; we instantiate it with Mysticeti and Mahi-Mahi at n >= 3f+1 and with the two variants of BlueBottle at n >= 5f+1. We prove it safe and live, and provide mechanized proofs in Lean 4. In simulation, Steelhead matches the partially synchronous protocol in a healthy network, stays close to the asynchronous one when network conditions stall the partially synchronous one, and adapts quickly in both directions.
