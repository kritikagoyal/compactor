## Summary
arXiv:2609.29395v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Training with a fixed global batch limits how many distributed clients can provide examples in any one step. We examine a way to use additional server workers without increasing the batch processed by an individual workload. Global Clustered Parallel Split Learning (GCPSL) assigns clients to fixed clusters, executes a Parallel Split Learning with Global Sampling (GPSL) workload for each cluster concurrently, and periodically fuses the client and server model segments. In simulations with 256 logical clients, dividing the population across more workloads improves direct data participation, while smaller clusters can incur an accuracy cost. A four-H100 implementation of label-aware GCPSL reaches 85% CIFAR-10 validation accuracy in minutes over three matched runs, versus minutes when the same workloads are serialized. Within the four-GPU allocation, size-balanced and random fixed affiliations reach the target in similar mean times (5.70 and 5.66 minutes); size balancing increases direct participation by 3.25 percentage points. These measurements characterize a trade-off among execution concurrency, assignment information, participation, and accuracy for stable-client split learning.
